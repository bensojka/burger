# DEVOUR THE BURGER https://burger-bms.herokuapp.com/

Make a burger and devour it! This burger logger web app was created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). It follows the MVC design pattern; uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate the HTML.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
